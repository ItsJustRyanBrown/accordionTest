# accordionTest
An accessible modern javascript accordion the best way I know how to make one.

So I wanted to improve this using some new tricks I learned.
-First I wanted to make it so this could be used without JavaScript and utilize the ::target pseudo class to change the style.
-I also wanted to to change the a tags from when there is no Javascript present to be buttons when there is JavaScript present.

I have achieved this but I now all the accordion triggers have the same name. I think I could probably fix this with iterating over an object.
